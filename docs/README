# DTI Docs


This repo contains the [NEW website]() for [Decision Transformer Interpretability](https://github.com/website_address_add_later.). This site is currently in Beta and we are in the process of adding/editing information.

The documentation uses Sphinx. However, the documentation is written in regular md, NOT rst.

If you are modifying a non-environment page or an atari environment page, please PR this repo. Otherwise, follow the steps below:

## Build the Documentation

Install the required packages:

Need to use python 3.9 (3.10 has an issue with napoleon extension) and below 3.8 doesn't have sphinx suppourt.
```
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
```

Using api doc to make the rst files

```bash
sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source .

cd docs

# build the docs from source
sphinx-autobuild -b dirhtml ./source build/html
```
